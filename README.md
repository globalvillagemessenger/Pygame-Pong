# Pygame-Pong
An original implementation of Pong using python and pygame

This is a multiplayer game requiring two players.

Player 1 is on the left side of the screen.
Player 1 controls: w = up, s = down

Player 2 is on the right side of the screen.
Player 2 controls: up arrow key = up, down arrow key = down


My aim was to write an implementation of Pong using python which both had 
a simple code and functioned smoothly when run. My code is an ideal read for
someone who is just learning how to use python.

That being said, I built this game using my idea of Pong and not as a perfect clone
of the original game of Pong. After building my program, I looked at the Wikipedia page for Pong,
which revealed that the game mechanics of the original game were slightly different
and relatively more complicated than my implementation. I say "relatively" because
Pong, in any of its implementations, is one of the simplest softwares you can write.
But what my implementation lacks in historical accuracy, it makes up for in fun!
